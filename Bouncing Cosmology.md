## What if the universe didn't start with the Big Bang?

Generally accepted: The Universe started from a single point of infinite density. (Big Bang)

But what if, instead, the Universe had no beginning and no end? What if it was contracting and expanding again and again? The "Big Bounce"!

## Is it possible that the evolution of the universe is $entirely$ described by a theory that is dominantly $classical$ ?

$\bullet$ no quantum-dominated phase
$\bullet$ no quantum-determined initial conditions
$\bullet$ no big bang
$\bullet$ geodesically complete: no beginning & no end
$\bullet$ coarse-grain properties deterministically set by classical equations
$\bullet$ (fine details due to quantum corrections)

...and if so, how would we know it?
(is there any information from the pre-bounce phase that makes it into the present phase? If yes, the how much info and how to we observe?)

Today: $a(t) = 1$ (a: Robertson-Walker scale factor "dimensionless", a key parameter of the Friedmann Equations)

### Basic Relations:

$${\text Hubble\ Parameter:\ }H \equiv \dfrac{\dot{a}}{a}$$

(tells us the rate at which the universe is expanding, or, contracting)
$$Friedmann\ Equation:\ 3H^2 = \frac{\rho_m}{a^3} + \frac{\rho_r}{a^4} + \frac{\rho_\phi}{a^{2\epsilon}} - \frac{3k}{a^2}$$


$$\epsilon \equiv \frac{3}{2}\left(1 + \frac{p}{\rho}\right)$$

(tells us how the Hubble parameter depends on what the universe contains and its geometry. $\rho_m$ is the matter density, $\rho_r$ is the radiation density, $\rho_\phi$ are other energy components, $\epsilon$ is the equation of state parameter which measures the ratio of the pressure to energy density, $k$ tells us the spatial curvature that's measuring the curvature of space at constant slices of time)
$$\boxed{H^{-1} \approx a^\epsilon}$$


($H^{-1}$ is called the Hubble Radius, which tells us the size of the observable universe at a given time $\epsilon$)
$$a(t) \approx |t|^{1/\epsilon}$$
(in an expanding universe, $t$ is growing, whereas, in a contracting universe, $t$ approaches $0$.)
$$\epsilon < 1:\ fast$$
$$\epsilon > 1: slow$$
$$\frac{\ddot{a}}{a} = \frac{1}{2} \rho (1 - \epsilon)$$

(acceleration of the universe! The sign of $\ddot{a}$ tells us whether the universe is contracting or expanding)

### Instead of calling it a big bang, let's call it a singularity problem!

Larger $\epsilon =$ Larger Pressure

$$\epsilon = 2\ for\ radiation$$
$$\epsilon = 3/2\ for\ matter$$

Initially, the universe is radiation dominated and therefore greater pressure and gradually, as the universe expands, it becomes more and more matter dominated.
$$Patch\ size\ = a(t)$$

$$Horizon\ size\ \approx a(t)^\epsilon$$

Note: Superhorizon hot & cold spots


## Flatness Problem

How flat is the universe in terms of the scale factor? To address this problem, divide the Friedmann Equation by $H^2$ on both sides.

$$1 = \frac{\rho_m}{3H^2a^3} + \frac{\rho_r}{3H^2a^4} + \frac{\rho_\phi}{3H^2a^{2\epsilon}} - \frac{3k}{3H^2a^2}$$

$$\Rightarrow 1 = \Omega_m + \Omega_r + \Omega_\phi + \Omega_k$$
$$\Rightarrow \Omega_k \equiv - \frac{3k}{3H^2a^2} \propto \left(\frac{H^{-1}}{a}\right)^2 \propto \left(\frac{hubble\ size}{patch\ size}\right)^2$$



Patch Size $\approx a(t)$ 
Horizon size $\approx a(t)^\epsilon$ 

$$\Rightarrow \left(\frac{hubble\ size}{patch\ size}\right) = \frac{horizon\ size}{curvature\ radius} \approx \frac{a(t)^\epsilon}{a(t)}$$

## List of problems to be solved:

1. Singularity Problem
2. Horizon Problem
3. Superhorizon Hot & Cold Spots
4. Flatness Problem


One option to solve these problems is to complete the other side of the "pizza" slice. That converts the Big Bang to a Big Bounce.
